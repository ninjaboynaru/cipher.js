# Cipher
Cipher is a proof of concept and practice cryptography application *(windows)*, running off the [Node Webkit](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/) runtime and utilizing streams for io transformation.  

Cipher currently uses simple XOR encryption to cipher and decipher and input file. No distinction is made between ciphered and uncyphered files, thus feeding in a ciphered file as the input, will decipher it.
